# fili-term

The Filigrane terminal (work in progress). Two processes:

- `fili-term-daemon` (`daemon/`, Rust, no Qt): owns the ptys and the terminal state through
  [`alacritty_terminal`](https://crates.io/crates/alacritty_terminal). Started on demand, it outlives the windows: a
  session survives a crash of the window and can be reattached (`fili-term list`, `fili-term --attach ID`).
- `fili-term` (Rust + Qt Quick through cxx-qt, software rendering): one process for every window. The grid is a
  `QQuickPaintedItem` subclass written in Rust (`src/gui/terminal.rs`) that paints only the damaged lines it receives
  over the daemon's socket (`src/proto.rs`). No hand-written C++: the Qt classes cxx-qt-lib lacks (key, mouse and
  input-method events, font metrics, clipboard) are bound straight to Qt's own members in the bridge. A frame is sent only after the window acknowledged the previous one, so a flood of output
  costs the window one frame per paint, never a queue.

## Build

```sh
export QMAKE=/usr/lib/qt6/bin/qmake6
cargo build --release --workspace
./target/release/fili-term            # FILI_TERM_TRACE=1 prints frame sizes, paint times and key→paint latency
```

Keys (V0): Ctrl+Shift+T new tab, Ctrl+Shift+W close tab, Ctrl+PgUp/PgDn switch tab, Ctrl+Shift+N new window,
Ctrl+Shift+C/V copy/paste, Shift+PgUp/PgDn history, Ctrl+plus/minus/0 font size. Shift+mouse selects even when a
program grabs the mouse.

## V0 measurements (2026-11-12, i5-1038NG7, niri, scale 1.75, window 707×858, JetBrains Mono 12 px)

| | foot | fili-term |
|---|---|---|
| `cat` 50 MB of base64 (idle machine) | 0.78–0.79 s | 0.78–1.04 s |
| key → painted (zsh echo, through the daemon) | n/a | median 1.7 ms, max 4.9 ms |
| memory, 1 terminal (PSS) | ≈ 10 MB | 41 MB window + 7 MB daemon |
| memory, 4 terminals (PSS) | ≈ 40 MB (4 windows) | 50 MB window (4 tabs) + 11 MB daemon |

Full-screen repaint: ≈ 4.5 ms (software). Hidden tabs drop their image.

## Not done yet (V1+)

the history, URL detection, command blocks (OSC 133), Rob actions, session sidebar.
